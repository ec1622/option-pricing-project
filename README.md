# option-pricing-project
In this project, I used Monte Carlo methods to price different types of options. I started by pricing Europea options using both the Black-Scholes formula and Monte Carlo simulation. I then priced American options using the Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm, and then extended the approach to Asian and barrier options. To improve the efficiency of the Monte Carlo simulations, I applied variance reduction techniques such as antithetic variates, control variates and importance sampling. I also calculated the Greeks using finite differences and used them to simulate delta-hedging with transaction costs. The objective is to demonstrate both practical implementation and theoretical understanding of numerical option pricing methods commonly used in quantitative finance.
